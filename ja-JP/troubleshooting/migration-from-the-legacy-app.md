# Migration from the Legacy App

**Migrate data from Alpha version (v 31.\* and older)**

If you’ve created content in the _Alpha (Legacy)_ version that you want to keep, you’ll need to migrate it.

The process is relatively straightforward:

1. Export from the Legacy app
2. Install & open the Beta app
3. Import to the Beta app

**Where to download the latest Alpha (Legacy) app**

If you have already deleted your Alpha app prior to exporting your data from it, you might want to download it again in order to complete the export. You can download the 0.31.9 desktop app for Mac, Windows, and Linux [via the following link](../).&#x20;



**Alternatives**&#x20;

Instead of migrating, you’ll have the following alternatives:

* Start fresh with our Beta app
* Selectively import your Objects one by one from Legacy to Beta _(You may want to do this if your Legacy account has become messy but you have a few projects you’d like to carry over to Beta)._

For these options, you’ll need to create a new account, which will generate a new Recovery Phrase.
